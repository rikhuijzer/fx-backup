# Speech by Frans Timmermans on Europe's Diversity

A [9 year old speech from Frans Timmermans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q94syUDDhxA), the former Executive Vice President of the European Commission for the European Green Deal and European Commissioner for Climate Action:

> Diversity is now, in some parts of Europe, seen as a threat.
> Diversity comes with challenges.
> But diversity is humanity's destiny.
> There is not going to be, even in the remotest places of this planet,
> a nation that will not see diversity in its future.
> That's where humanity is heading.
> And those politicians trying to sell to their electorates,
> a society that is exclusively composed of people from one culture,
> are trying to portray a future based on a past that never existed.
> Therefore, that future will never be.
> Europe will be diverse.
> Like all other parts of the world, we'd be diverse.
> The only question is, how do we deal with that diversity?
> And my answer to that is,
> by ensuring that our values determine how we deal with diversity
> and not giving up our values to refuse diversity,
> that will bring us down as a society.
> If we don't get this right,
> I truly believe Europe will not remain the Europe we've built.
> Europe will not remain a place of peace and freedom for very long.
