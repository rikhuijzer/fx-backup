# The Real Enemy Isn't Who You Think It is

Transcript from [a video from Chase Hughes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6JyWD_XuXfE):

> Let me say you one thing that is true.
> You and that weird uncle that you argue with at thanksgiving, you are not enemies, you are both being played.
> You are both being manipulated.
> And the second that you realize that, the second you look across the isle and see a fellow human being instead of some caricature cartoon, is the moment that the scam starts to collapse.
>
> Let me be crystal clear about one thing.
> The real enemy isn't your democrat neighbor with the yard sign that pisses you off.
> It is not your republican uncle who posts stupid memes on Facebook.
> The real enemy is entrenched power.
> It is entrenched power that thrives on one piece of fuel and that fuel is chaos.
> The real enemy is those people that profit when you are divided and distracted, and most importantly, when you are dehumanizing your fellow American.
> This was never about left versus right.
> It was always about the people versus the powerful.
