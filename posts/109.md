# The Real Enemy Isn't Who You Think It is

Transcript from [a video from Chase Hughes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6JyWD_XuXfE):

> Let me say you one thing that is true.
> You and that weird uncle that you argue with at thanksgiving, you are not enemies, you are both being played.
> You are both being manipulated.
> And the second that you realize that, the second you look across the isle and see a fellow human being instead of some caricature cartoon, is the moment that the scam starts to collapse.
>
> Let me be crystal clear about one thing.
> The real enemy isn't your democrat neighbor with the yard sign that pisses you off.
> It is not your republican uncle who posts stupid memes on Facebook.
> The real enemy is entrenched power.
> It is entrenched power that thrives on one piece of fuel and that fuel is chaos.
> The real enemy is those people that profit when you are divided and distracted, and most importantly, when you are dehumanizing your fellow American.
> This was never about left versus right.
> It was always about the people versus the powerful.

And a great [comment](https://youtube.com/shorts/6JyWD_XuXfE?lc=UgzL9Oz5V4LVf69-kiJ4AaABAg):

> My daughter came home from school and said,
“Dad, you’re not going to believe what happened in history class today.”
>
> Her teacher told the class they were going to play a game.
He walked around the room and whispered to each student whether they were a witch or just a regular person. Then he gave the instructions:
>
> “Form the biggest group you can without a witch. If your group has even one, you all fail.”
>
> She said the whole room instantly lit up with suspicion.
> Everyone started interrogating each other. Are you a witch? How do we know you’re not lying?
> Some students clung to one big group, but most broke off into smaller, exclusive cliques. They turned away anyone who seemed uncertain, nervous, or gave off even the slightest hint of being guilty.
>
> The energy shifted fast. Suddenly everyone was suspicious of everyone.
> Whispers. Finger-pointing. Side-eyes. Trust dissolved in minutes.
>
> Finally, when all the groups were formed, the teacher said,
“Alright, time to find out who fails. Witches, raise your hands.”
>
> And not one hand went up.
>
> The whole class exploded. “Wait! You messed up the game!”
>
> And then the teacher dropped the bomb:
> “Did I? Were there any actual witches in Salem, or did everyone just believe what they were told?”
>
> My daughter said the room went dead silent.
>
> That’s when it hit them. No witch was ever needed for the damage to > happen. Fear had already done its work. Suspicion alone divided the entire class, turning community into chaos.
>
> And isn’t that exactly what we’re seeing today?
> Different words, same playbook.
> Instead of “witch,” it’s liberal, conservative, vaxxed, unvaxxed, pro-this, anti-that.
> The labels shift, but the tactic is the same.
>
> Get people scared. Get them suspicious. Get them divided.
> Then sit back while trust crumbles.
>
> The danger was never the witch.
> The danger is the rumor. The suspicion. The fear. The planted lies.
>
> Refuse the whisper. Don’t play the game. Because the second we start hunting “witches,” we’ve already lost.
