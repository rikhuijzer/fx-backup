Then suddenly in March, China’s Ministry of Commerce jumped ahead and [withheld approval for BYD’s Mexico plant](https://www.ft.com/content/36ae6f78-aadb-47bb-a5cd-ec69b420cbe1), arguing that BYD’s technology might get “leaked” to the US (which doesn’t make any sense given the many BYD plants [popping up all over the world](https://www.high-capacity.com/p/china-is-trying-to-reshape-global)).

One explanation for this pattern of actions is a battle over symbolic control. Rather than getting hit by a ban by the other side, it looks like you have more control when you jump ahead and implement the ban first yourself. It’s like the classic line: 'You can’t fire me—I quit.'"
