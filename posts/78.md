# Stephen Kotkin on Collectivization

[Stephen Kotkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCWvAZ0eknY) at 47:00:

> And in the process of doing it, [Stalin] caused famine and was undermining, potentially, the party's own rule.
> He just kept going all the way through because he had the courage of his conviction.
> And then when they complained about him he made a mental note of that and he enacted his version of revenge on them a few years later for their criticisms of him when he did this.
> So he did this because he believed in the Marxist/Leninist fashion that this had to be done.
> He himself felt a man of destiny and therefore he could do this and he was looking to find the shock troops to galvanize the half-educated youth to take violence out on these gulags and to force the villagers into these collective arrangements.
> And so what he did and so this is what totalitarianism is: he galvanized people's agency  and those people using their agency destroyed their own agency.
> They disempowered themselves by by taking up this call.
