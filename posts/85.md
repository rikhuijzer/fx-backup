# Whether Settler Colonialism is Progressive

From _On Settler Colonialism: Ideology, Violence, and Justice_ by Adam Kirsch:

> If the definition of a progressive movement is that it believes the future can be better than the past, then the ideology of settler colonialism is not progressive, because it believes the past was better than the future.
