# A new description for the YouTube Wikipedia "fact checking"

In a YouTube comment, someone gave a great description for the Wikipedia fact-checking:

The correct description for this box is "the blue box of gaslighting".

Brought you to by a comment below a video of [JP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSuUHaEE9k).
