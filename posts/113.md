# A new description for the YouTube Wikipedia "fact checking"

In a YouTube comment, someone gave a great description for the Wikipedia fact-checking:

![YouTube_screenshot_demonstrating_Wikipedia_fact-checking.png](/files/ce94431fd8117f45)

The correct description for this "context" is "the blue box of gaslighting". In general, the word "context" visible above the box is also misleading since providing "context" is often an euphemism for lying.

Brought you to by a comment below a video of [JP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSuUHaEE9k).
