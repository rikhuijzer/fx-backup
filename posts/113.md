# A new description for the YouTube Wikipedia "fact checking"

In a YouTube comment, someone gave a great description for the Wikipedia fact-checking:

![YouTube_screenshot_demonstrating_Wikipedia_fact-checking.png](/files/ce94431fd8117f45)

The correct description for this "context" is "the blue box of gaslighting". "Context" in general is an euphemism for lying most of the times.

Brought you to by a comment below a video of [JP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSuUHaEE9k).
