# The Government Is Lying to You

From [Comedy Central Stand-Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6NmjK2pgiQ):

> Now there are just certain people I have no time for like if you're sexist or homophobic, or if you don't believe in conspiracy theories.
> How don't you believe in any conspiracy theories?
> I understand not all of them.
> Not most of them.
> But you don't believe in any conspiracy theory?
> You think the government is just batting 1000 and telling us the whole truth?
> That's a strong stance to take.
