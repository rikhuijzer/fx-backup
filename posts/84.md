# Communism in a Nutshell

The idea of communism is that inequality is reduced by getting rid of rich people. Once communism gets under way, everybody is equal. Except the government. Or as Orwell wrote: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others”. In the DDR, you could recognize a party-member by the fact that they drove a Volvo. Normal people drove a Trabant.
