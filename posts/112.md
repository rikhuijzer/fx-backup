# What to do to understand the Western world

If you want to understand the Western world, just read the scriptures of the three main religions. Even when you are not religious that **DOES NOT MEAN** other people are also not religious. Billions of people read these scriptures weekly if not daily. They explain 90% of what's happening.

I'm often reading books where some author put in countless hours of research to figure out a certain event, and while I'm reading it and can't help but notice that it's often exactly in accordance with the religious beliefs of the subject.
