# pathsofstoicism on "mental resets"

From [pathsofstoicism](https://substack.com/@pathsofstoicism/note/c-118046481):

> Best mental reset I’ve learned:
>
> If your mind is loud — **Write**.
>
> If your mind is empty — **Read**.
>
> If your mind is racing — **Walk**.
>
> If your mind is tired — **Sleep**.
>
> If your mind is sharp — **Build**.
>
> Most problems are just _mismatched energy_. Get the inputs right, the rest follows.
