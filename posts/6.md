# Set -euxo pipefail

To make working with Bash scripts less problematic, I've switched to this default shebang and settings:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euxo pipefail
```

The first line tells the interpreter to run the file via `bash` as found at `/usr/bin/env`. This `/usr/bin/env` is one of the most platform-independent locations that I know (it even works on NixOS).

The second line makes it much easier to find problems in the script. The `-e` option will cause the script to fail immediately when a command fails, the `-o pipefail` will also crash if one of the commands in a pipe fails (this could have avoided a [Cloudflare outage](<https://youtu.be/kUtarOlOT3Y>)), `-u` will treat unset variables as error, and `-x` will print each command before execution.
