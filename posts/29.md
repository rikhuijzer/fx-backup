# The logit and logistic functions

Linear regression works on real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, that is, the input and output are in $\mathbb{R}$.
For probabilities, this is problematic because the linear regression will happily give a probability of $-934$, where we know that probabilities should always lie between $0$ and $1$.
This is only by definition, but it is an useful definition in practice.
Informally, the *logistic* function converts values from real numbers to probabilities and the *logit* function does the reverse.

## Logistic

The logistic function converts values from $(-\infty, \infty)$ to $(0, 1)$:

$$
\text{logistic}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}.
$$

We can easily define this function ourselves:

```julia
mylogistic(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
```

But, also load it from `StatsFuns.jl`:

```julia
using StatsFuns: logistic
```

```julia
mylogistic(1) == logistic(1)
```

```julia
I = -8:0.01:8
fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1]; xlabel="x", ylabel="logistic(x)")
lines!(ax, I, logistic.(I))
xlims!(ax, -6, 6)
fig
```

If you care enough, you could decide to remember the plot by heart.
Some people advise to remember the following numbers by heart.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{logistic}(-3) &\approx 0.05, \\
\text{logistic}(-1) &\approx \tfrac{1}{4}, \\
\text{logistic}(1) &\approx \tfrac{3}{4}, \: \text{and} \\
\text{logistic}(3) &\approx 0.95.
\end{aligned}
$$

since

```julia
r2(x) = round(x; digits=2);
```

```julia
logistic(-3) |> r2
```

0.05

```julia
logistic(-1) |> r2
```

0.27

```
logistic(1) |> r2
```

0.73

```
logistic(3) |> r2
```

0.95

## Logit

The inverse of the logistic function is the _logit_ function:

$$
\text{logit}(x) = \log\frac{x}{1 - x}
$$

```julia
mylogit(x) = log(x / (1 - x));
```

```julia
logit(1) == mylogit(1)
```

```raw
true
```

This function goes from $(0, 1)$ to $(-\infty, \infty)$:

```julia
I = 0:0.001:1
fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1]; xlabel="x", ylabel="logit(x)")
lines!(ax, I, logit.(I))
xlims!(ax, 0, 1)
ylims!(ax, -6, 6)
current_figure()
```
