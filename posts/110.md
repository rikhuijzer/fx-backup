# Wolves in the Netherlands

In the Netherlands, we currently have about 100 wolves walking around.
Politicians say this is a "natural phenomenon" and that they walked here from their own volition.
Meanwhile animals in rural areas are being killed by these wolves and [even a runner has been attacked](https://www.rtvdrenthe.nl/nieuws/16264305/zeven-vragen-over-afschot-van-wolven-als-je-gaat-schieten-komen-er-meer-welpen), while the government forbids the shooting of them because they want to first "establish a healthy state of conservation."

Various other groups question the theory since the Netherlands is a tiny country which no real large swaths of land.
Hunters argue that wolves are not even happy here.
They need real nature to roam around in not the fake human-made nature that the Netherlands has.
I am leaning to this side since the whole problem to me appears to be yet another fake problem.
It's a distraction.

The main argument as I see it against wolves is very simple.
Here is some data for the amount of people per square kilometer in various countries.

The Netherlands: **533** inhabitants per square kilometer.

United States: **38** inhabitants per square kilometer.

Russia: **9** inhabitants per square kilometer.

Canada: **4** inhabitants per square kilometer.
