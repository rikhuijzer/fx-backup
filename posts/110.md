# Wolves in the Netherlands

In the Netherlands, we currently have about [100 wolves walking around](https://www.ed.nl/binnenland/er-leven-bijna-honderd-wolven-in-nederland-en-dat-worden-er-nog-meer-er-is-nog-wel-ruimte~ae59391d1/).
Politicians say this is a "natural phenomenon" and that they walked here from their own volition.
Meanwhile animals in rural areas are being killed by these wolves and [even a runner has been attacked](https://www.rtvdrenthe.nl/nieuws/16264305/zeven-vragen-over-afschot-van-wolven-als-je-gaat-schieten-komen-er-meer-welpen), while the government forbids the shooting of them because they want to first "establish a healthy state of conservation."
The media is now even informing people about how to spot the difference between a [wolf and a dog](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/editienl/video/24be247c-8cb3-42fe-b136-cdf16d3a7d7d/oog-oog-met-een-wolf-hond-dit-zijn-de).

Various other groups question the theory since the Netherlands is a tiny country which no real large swaths of land.
Hunters argue that wolves [are not even happy here](
They need real nature to roam around in not the fake human-made nature that the Netherlands has.
I am leaning to this side since the whole problem to me appears to be yet another fake problem.
Like so many things, it's a distraction.
_Divide and conquer._

The main argument as I see it against wolves is very simple.
Here is some data for the amount of people per square kilometer in various countries.

The Netherlands: **533** inhabitants per square kilometer.

United States: **38** inhabitants per square kilometer.

Russia: **9** inhabitants per square kilometer.

Canada: **4** inhabitants per square kilometer.
