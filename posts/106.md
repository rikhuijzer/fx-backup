# Interesting Theory About Charlie Kirk's Assassination

According to [Michael on X](https://x.com/Saint___Michael/status/1966059091454800271):

> The moment that Charlie Kirk is ‘shot’ you can clearly see the blood pack vest and tube/wire leading to it under his shirt.
>
> Maybe not have the ‘victim’ wear a white T shirt the next time you pull a fake assassination huh?

I myself think this is plausible, because since ever since I saw the video, I just couldn't figure out why his shirt would jump up like it did.
There was one shot with the entry or exit wound at his neck, but the shirts blows upwards in front of his stomach.
From the shirt, you would thus expect that the bullet exploded somewhere around his stomach, but then that wouldn't explain the wound at his neck.

Having a device that moves in position and then pumps blood out, like in the movies, seems then more plausible if you just look at the video as a stand-alone event.

This theory is also presented by [Martin Vrijland](https://www.martinvrijland.nl/nieuws-analyses/de-charlie-kirk-hoax-het-hoe-en-waarom/). And by someone else on [Rumble](https://rumble.com/v6ytfgo-charlie-kirk-shooting-hoax-100-exposed.html).

He shows how masks can be put in front of the neck while being connected to a tube:

Then there is also the video which shows that Kirk was [thrown in a black van by a security team](https://rumble.com/v6z0fjw-charlie-kirk-hoax-no-ambulance-tossed-in-black-van...-no-blood.html) while no blood seems to be falling on the ground. It's possible of course that he was shot but it's somewhat surprising.

So I don't know.
It all just doesn't make sense and I can't wait for an official theory that explains the evidence better than the existing theories.
