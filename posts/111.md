# Companies are Lying About AI Layoffs

Companies are saying that the economy and AI are causing the large amount of tech layoffs, but [Vanessa Wing√•rdh looked at the H-1B visa data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Ecodxn5m4) and noticed that the companies are lying.

She argues that the American employees are being replaced by cheaper H-1B visa workers.
[WSJ also reported on this due to some senators speaking up.](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/h1b-visa-grassley-durbin-letter-tech-firms-8fe931e9)
As proof she uses the H-1B [data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub).
When filtering by fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, the number of Beneficiaries Approved for some of the big corporations as of 30 June 2025 are shown in the second column below.
I also searched a bit for news articles about layoffs and put those numbers in the third column.
