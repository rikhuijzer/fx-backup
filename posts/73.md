# Grading Historians

I've listened to many podcasts with historians over the years and I just realized one thing that my favorite historians all have in common: you can just watch/listen to a talk from years ago and it will still feel accurate.

You basically can't hear which year it currently is.
Great historians talk about long lasting and persistent phenomena instead of ephemeral ones.
