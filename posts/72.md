# Misinformation

There is this common narrative that social media promotes misinformation since you can end up in a bubble. But non-social media also doesn’t have to be correct, does it? So then it’s about which of the two publishes more misinformation? It probably depends on what bubble you might end up in.

At least you could say bubbles are more diverse. One person can be inside one bubble and another in another so for society overall they might cancel out? Or maybe new ideas might start to arise?

Maybe the argument should be that mass (social) media may lead to misinformation since both correct and incorrect messages would be amplified.
