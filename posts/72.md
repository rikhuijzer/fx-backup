# Misinformation

There is this common narrative that social media promotes misinformation since you can end up in a bubble. But non-social media also doesn’t have to be correct, does it? So then it’s about which of the two publishes more misinformation? It probably depends on what bubble you might end up in. But at least if you have bubbles then misinformation is more non-conforming. One person can be inside one bubble and another in another so for society overall they might cancel out? And then the good ideas can bubble up?
