Blogs are still very much alive. [This post](<https://www.capturedlambda.dev/blog/zig-allocators-rust_ergo/>) by Tommy Breslein for example would not have worked as one or more tweets. As a YouTube video maybe it would have worked but even then itâ€™s hard to beat the effectiveness of a clear blog post.
