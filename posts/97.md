# Does Whitney Webb fear for her life after exposing corruption?

Whitney Webb wrote _A Nation Under Blackmail_, which exposed blackmail rings in the United States. She gave a great answer to the question on [whether she now fears for her life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3GwoEbDz6M):

> I ultimately think, you know, to paraphrase a line from the sci-fi book Dune: "fear is the mind-killer." [...] I think fear is the ultimate tool that benefits [the elite] instead of us.

Full quote from Dune:

> I must not fear.
> Fear is the mind-killer.
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
> I will face my fear.
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
>
> Only I will remain.
