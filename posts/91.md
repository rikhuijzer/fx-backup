# Sunlight is the Best Disinfectant

Quoting [Alasdair S. Roberts](https://alasdairroberts.ca/2015/03/01/where-brandeis-got-sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant/):

> Louis Brandeis is credited with writing that “Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.”  But why did Brandeis say that sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants?  Because he was referring to a statement by James Bryce in his 1888 book, _The American Commonwealth_.

The quote:

> Public opinion is a sort of atmosphere, fresh, keen, and full of sunlight, like that of the American cities, and this sunlight kills many of those noxious germs which are hatched where politicians congregate. That which, varying a once famous phrase, we may call the genius of universal publicity, has some disagreeable results, but the wholesome ones are greater and more numerous. Selfishness, injustice, cruelty, tricks, and jobs of all sorts shun the light; to expose them is to defeat them. No serious evils, no rankling sore in the body politic, can remain long concealed, and when disclosed, it is half destroyed.
