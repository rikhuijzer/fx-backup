The large Dutch pension fund ABP achieved an annual return of about 6% over the last 20 years, according to <https://www.abp.nl/over-abp/duurzaam-en-verantwoord-beleggen/beleggingsresultaten>. The S&P 500 had a 10.392% return (dividends invested) over 20 years, according to <https://tradethatswing.com/average-historical-stock-market-returns-for-sp-500-5-year-up-to-150-year-averages/>.

This means that if you would have put €10.000 into the ABP in 2005, then that would have compounded to $10 000 \cdot 1.06^{20}$ = €32.071 today. If you would have put that money in the S&P 500 instead, it would have compounded to $10 000 \cdot 1.10^{20}$ = €67.274.

This means that you would have roughly made twice as much money in the S&P.
