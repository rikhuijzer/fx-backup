[This speech](<https://youtu.be/g1pwS33fE48>) by Oliver Anthony is exactly my social media experience as well. A few people are famous and get all the attention while the rest are "nobodies". I think it's a bit inherent to the massive scale of social media. In a small town, it's hard to be a complete nobody. At least some people know your parents or have seen you in the supermarket, for example.
